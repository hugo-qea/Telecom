other tools) to enable the usage of SQL commands within a Jupyter Notebook as in common SQL clients.\n","- Before proceeding, make sure that **`wine.db`** is in the same path as this notebook.\n","  - If **`wine.db`** is not in the same path, an empty **`wine.db`** file will be created, resulting in errors in later steps of the TP.\n","- The SQLite module in Python commits transactions automatically, this means that any change in the DB is immediately written to the file, e.g. creating/deleting tables.\n","  -  For this reason, it is recommended to have a backup of **`wine.db`** as it is provided in the course's website.\n","\n","---"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"YnyNi0lVam3L"},"source":["**`wine.db`** contains the following unnormalized
